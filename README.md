The basic idea
--------------

You can set CGA text mode to 100 rows, in which the top two scanlines from each character are displayed. The 8x8 font is in ROM, so the font has to be built up from 8x2 bitmaps, which can be inverted. With these patterns we want to build up a font of any size which is a multiple of 8x2, which looks good.

The approach
------------

We could do this by hand, but that would be rather boring and easy. So what I'd like to do is take an approach which is generative. I want to somehow define a font, from which a lot of different fonts could be generated by changing parameters (thickness, perturbing anchor points, etc). The parameter space is explored, maybe by some kind of hillclimbing algorithm or with evolutionary approaches, until a nice, consistent, readable font is found.

While I'm unsure about how I'm going to define and generate the fonts, I'll start by constraining the problem to the digits 0 to 9.

Applications
------------

Some kind of computer demonstration programme, I should think.
